\DIFaddend %Problem, motivation and significance
%TODO the origin of neuromorphic computing
%Neuromorphic computing has lead towards the development of biologically-inspired computer architectures 
Advances in computing power and machine learning have \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{benefited }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{endowed }\DIFaddend computers with a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{rapid }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rapidly }\DIFaddend growing performance in cognitive tasks \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend such as recognising objects~\citep{deng2009imagenet} and playing GO~\citep{silver2016mastering}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)}\DIFdelend . 
These tasks were once dominated by human intelligence and solved by biological neurons in the brain.
However, humans and many other animals still win against computers in practical tasks, such as vision, and outperform \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{them }\DIFaddend in terms of size and energy cost \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{over }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by }\DIFaddend several orders of magnitude.
For instance, AlphaGO~\citep{silver2016mastering} consumed 1~MW of power on its 1920 CPUs and 280 GPUs when playing the game with one of the best human players whose brain only consumed about 20~W.
%DIF < Although we are still far from understanding the brain thoroughly, it is believed that the performance gap between computation in the biological nervous system and in a computer lies in the fundamental computing units and the way they act.
%DIF < Computers employ Boolean logic and deterministic digital operations based usually on synchronous clocks while nervous systems employ parallel-distributed, event-driven, stochastic unreliable components~\citep{indiveri2009artificial}.

NE was proposed by Carver Mead in the late 1980s \citep{Mead:1989:AVN:64998} to build analogue circuits \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that mimic the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which mimic }\DIFaddend biological neural cells and the architecture of the nervous system using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{very-large-scale integration }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Very-Large-Scale Integration }\DIFaddend (VLSI) technology.

}%DIFAUXCMD
, }\DIFaddend the objectives of NE \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can be summarised as follows}\DIFaddend ~\citep{furber2007neural}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{neuromorphic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{brain }\DIFaddend modelling: for neuroscientists to understand the brain by modelling and simulating the activities of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend biological neurons;

\end{itemize}
This is a bidirectional process\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; }\DIFaddend building a biologically inspired computer requires a better understanding of the brain, and simulating brain activities at large scale and in real time \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can be only feasible }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is feasible only }\DIFaddend on massively-parallel neuromorphic hardware.



\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since around 2004 to 2005, `Dennard's Law' has no longer been followed~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bohr200730}
}%DIFAUXCMD
, so as transistors get smaller their power density no longer stays constant but starts to increase.
The breakdown of Dennard scaling and the problem of power dissipation drove chip manufacturers to multi/many-core architecture.
However, the increased number of active transistors in a multi-core chip costs more power consumption thus creating the prospect that some fraction of the cores will have to remain completely powered-off given the thermal design power constraint.

Neuromorphic engineering offers a potential solution for power dissipation by applying the biological features of event-driven, hybrid analogue/digital, unreliable components to computers.
Moreover, most of the neural interconnections in the brain are local, and the `memory' units attach to the `computation' node in a neuron.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) hold the key as the main approach for both goals.
The so-called third generation of artificial neural network (ANN)~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend The spiking neuron mathematically models the dynamics of a single neuron \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with biological realism }\DIFaddend and the network describes the architecture of the neural connections and the information transmission among them\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

while computer engineers can }\DIFaddend focus on the hardware implementations of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{SNN models.
Hence, SNN simulation tools~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

have been developed to allow exploration of the brain by mimicking its functions and developing large-scale practical applications~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{eliasmith2012large}

.
In addition, neuromorphic engineering has delivered biologically-inspired sensors such as DVS~(Dynamic Vision Sensor)silicon retinas~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

%DIF < how to operate these brain-like machines to be competent in cognitive applications still remains unsolved.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The long-term ultimate goal of NE is to equip neuromorphic machines with genuine intelligence~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{konar1999artificial}

Today, in neuromorphic modelling, we know that information processing in the brain is conducted by the basic computing units, the spiking neurons. 
Information transmission takes place in the synapses and we can draw the connections among neurons from anatomical experiments.

Some of these neuromorphic computers~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

Instead of executing sequential instructions and building systems of separated computing and memory units, they rather copy the nature of the brain: implement neurons, synapses and neuronal communications on analogue/digital microelectronics.
Therefore this novel architecture may solve the problem of the microprocessor/memory performance gap~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{wulf1995hitting}
}%DIFAUXCMD
, also known as the Von Neumann bottleneck, where the system speed is determined and limited by the memory performance;
and at the same time, these neuromorphic computers develop into energy-efficient systems by reducing the energy used for data moving between processors and memories, and employing event-based computing.

\DIFadd{Simulations of massive SNNs~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{due to the fundamental difference of data representation and neural computation between spiking and artificial neurons, how to operate these brain-like machines to be competent in cognitive applications still remains unsolved}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the SNN simulations only reconstruct the non-functional network behaviours and neural dynamics of some subsystem of the brain, `but without precisely functionally simulating that subsystem'~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

%DIF < TODO need to modify
Despite remarkable computational success, ANNs ignore the spiking nature of neural communication that is fundamental for biological neuronal networks.
At the same time, to catch up with ANNs ' ability to beat human performance using SNNs, a shared ultimate goal has emerged.

Although, theoretical studies have shown that biologically-plausible learning, e.g. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity~(STDP), could approximate a stochastic version of powerful machine learning algorithms, such as Expectation Maximization~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

%DIF > %Stochasticity, in contrast with the continuously differentiable functions used by ANNs, is intrinsic to the event-based spiking process, making network training difficult.

Firstly, }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{main challenge is to close the gap of the cognition performance of SNNs and ANNs .
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fundamental difference of data representation and neural computation between spiking and artificial neurons makes it difficult to transform ANN models to SNN algorithms, see Chapter~\ref{cha:bkg} for more detail.
%DIF > %Therefore it is relative easy to build SNN models and observe their dynamics for use in neuroscience, but much harder to construct SNNs with biological realism and specific functions for AI applications.
Secondly, the computation cost for simulating large SNNs of size as big as commonly-used deep ANNs was considered to be infeasible, but has been gradually solved by NE.
Chapter~\ref{cha:bench} summarises the recent development of applying SNNs in AI tasks, where these SNN models perform as `reactive' systems and exploit Winner-Take-All~(WTA) circuits and spike-based plasticity~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bill2014compound,diehl2015unsupervised}

.
These models are `reactive' since they are typically comprised of only two neural layers, where the output neurons simply react to the input.
Therefore, such SNNs are difficult to perform sophisticated effective cognition.
}\DIFaddend 


%DIF < TODO Why it motivates me (why it would be useful and important to have a solution)
%DIF > Therefore, with the neuromorphic hardware ready, the increasing knowledge of SNNs and the success of Deep Learning in ANNs, it is time to take an extra step towards the ultimate goal of NE by equipping neuromorphic computers with equivalent performance as ANNs' to solve AI engineering tasks.

%DIF > %However, the SNN has not achieved the performance of its non-spiking counterpart, the ANN, in cognitive tasks particularly when used in deep neural networks.

%DIF > Meanwhile, Deep Learning research in the field of ANNs has dominated state-of-the-art solutions for AI engineering tasks, e.g. exceeding human-level performance on image classification~\citep{he2015delving}, see Chapter~\ref{cha:dnn} for more examples.
\DIFadd{Therefore, researchers turn to Deep Learning for building `smarter' SNNs.
Initial studies have shown that SNNs can be trained by first training an equivalent deep ANN and then transferring the tuned weights to the SNN.
This method is called `off-line' training, since it does not take place on SNNs directly, but rather on ANNs instead.
Chapter~\ref{cha:Conv} discusses these `off-line' training models in detail, and proposes a simple, generalised, off-line SNN training method to overcome the problems of poor modelling accuracy and high computational complexity of the existing methods~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Jug_etal_2012,hunsberger2015spiking,diehl2015fast}
}%DIFAUXCMD
.
In terms of `On-line' training, see Chapter~\ref{cha:sdlm}, Deep Learning modules are trained purely on SNNs in an event-driven manner.
Previous work~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{neil2013online,neftci2013event,burbank2015mirrored}
}%DIFAUXCMD
has failed to provide SNNs with recognition accuracy equivalent to ANNs due to the lack of mathematical analysis.
We continue the inspiring works on these biologically-plausible `on-line' training and propose a formalised method to train layered-up Deep Learning modules on SNNs.
To provide meaningful comparisons between these proposed SNN models and other existing methods within the rapidly advancing field of NE, we propose a large dataset of spike-based visual stimuli and a corresponding evaluation methodology to estimate the overall performance of SNN models and their hardware implementations in Chapter~\ref{cha:bench}.

\section{Contributions}
The primary achievements of the work described in this thesis are the training of deep SNNs, both off-line and on-line, which close the gap of cognitive capability between SNNs and ANNs.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The other achievement }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Other achievements }\DIFaddend contribute to the performance evaluation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend SNN models and their hardware implementation.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The contributions are:
}\DIFaddend \begin{itemize}
%	\item 
%	An implementation of a real-time hand postures recognition system on a neuromorphic hardware platform.
%	It demonstrated the prototype of a complete neuromorphic system which may form the default configuration of a real-time, energy-efficient and low-latency recognition system.
%	
%	This work comprises Chapter 3 and was published and presented to the International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks 2015.

	\item 
	a generalised SNN training method to train an equivalent ANN and transfer the trained weights back to SNNs.

	This simple method addresses the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{problem }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problems }\DIFaddend of inaccurate modelling and high computation complexity of existing approaches.
	This training procedure consists of two simple stages: first, estimate parameter $p$ for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parametric activation function}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Parametric Activation Function}\DIFaddend ~(PAF: $y = p \times f(x)$) using the proposed activation function Noisy Softplus~(NSP), and second, use a PAF version of conventional activation functions for ANN training. % can be generalised to activation units other than NSP.
	%The training of a SNN model is exactly the same as ANN training, and 
	The trained weights can be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{directly used in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used directly in the }\DIFaddend SNN without any further transformation.
	This method requires the least \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{computation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{computational }\DIFaddend complexity while performing most effectively among existing algorithms.

%	A simple and generalised off-line SNN training method which employs a novel activation function, Noisy Softplus.
%	The activation function accurately models the neural response activity of spiking neurons.
%	In addition, it enables an off-line SNN to be trained just like an ANN, and the trained weights can be directly used in SNNs without any conversion.
%	This network training is a generalised method and the activation function can be applied, in principle, in any architecture of a neural network.
%	It was tested on a convolutional network and showed a recognition capability a close to the conventional ANN. 

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The proposal of NSP contributes to Chapter4 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{NSP is described in Chapter~\ref{cha:Conv} }\DIFaddend and was published and presented \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at }\DIFaddend the International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP 2016);

\section{Thesis Structure}
The thesis comprises the following seven chapters:

\textbf{Chapter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{cha:intro}}\DIFaddend } introduces the origin and the motivation of the research, states the problem, defines the hypotheses and objectives, summarises the contributions and publications, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{outlined }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{outlines }\DIFaddend the thesis. 

\textbf{Chapter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{cha:bkg}}\DIFaddend } %briefs the short history	 of Neuromorphic Engineering which leads to the author's research, lists the common spiking neural models and learning approaches, introduces the neuromorphic hardware devices.
illustrates how biological neurons function, transmit signals between them, and are modelled by mathematical abstractions, thus to unveil the special features of spiking neurons that differ from \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend neurons of ANNs; and introduces SNN simulators both in software and in hardware including neuromorphic systems.

\textbf{Chapter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{cha:dnn}}\DIFaddend } gives an overview of popular architectures and models of Deep Learning and illustrates the mechanism of the convolutional network~(ConvNet), the Autoencode~(AE), and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine~(RBM) in detail.

\textbf{Chapter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{cha:Conv}}\DIFaddend } demonstrates the generalised off-line SNN training method by using \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend novel biologically-inspired activation function, Noisy Softplus, which is well-matched to the response function of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons; and validates the performance by testing on a convolutional network.

\textbf{Chapter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{cha:sdlm}}\DIFaddend } proposes the STDP-based learning algorithm for training spiking AEs and RBMs; and shows equivalent recognition capability of SNNs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{comparing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{compared }\DIFaddend to ANNs.

\textbf{Chapter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{cha:bench}}\DIFaddend } puts forward the spike-based vision dataset and the evaluation methodology; and presents two case studies as tentative benchmarks running on SpiNNaker to assess the hardware-level performance against software simulators.

\textbf{Chapter\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{7}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{cha:conc}}\DIFaddend } summarises the research, discusses the contributions to the field, points out future directions and concludes the thesis.

	\DIFadd{In brief, Figure~\ref{fig:intro} summarises the introduction and demonstrates the outline of the thesis.
	NE aims at understanding the brain and building brain-like machines.
	Although progress has been made in both directions, it is still far from achieving the long term goal of Neuromorphic Cognition.
	With the support of accumulated knowledge of SNNs and the massive neuromorphic SNN simulators, plus the huge success of Deep Learning in ANNs, the research of the thesis targets at enabling deep SNNs with equivalent performance of ANNs on AI tasks thus approaching Neuromorphic Cognition.
	To achieve the thesis aim, we propose an on-line and an off-line SNN training methods to bring Deep Learning advantages to SNNs, and provide a spike-based dataset and its corresponding evaluation methodology to measure the performance of SNNs and their hardware implementations.
